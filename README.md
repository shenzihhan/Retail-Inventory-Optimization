## Retail Inventory Optimization Using Linear Programming

This project applies **operations research** and **Linear Programming** techniques to optimize inventory and discount pricing strategies in a multi-category retail environment.

Using open-source inventory data from Kaggle, we developed a **linear programming model** that determines:

- When to **restock** and how much to order
- When and where to offer **discounts** to stimulate sales
- How to maximize total **profit** while accounting for:
  - Seasonal demand changes
  - Limited warehouse space
  - Category-specific cost and margin structures

---

### Key Outcomes

- **Solver-based Optimization:** Created an Excel LP model to solve for maximum profit under business constraints
- **Discount Strategy Evaluation:** Tested multiple discount timing strategies across five categories
- **Result:** Achieved a total profit of **$693,274** across 5 months

---

### Categories Covered

- Toys  
- Electronics  
- Groceries  
- Furniture  
- Clothing  

Each category had unique cost structures, demand patterns, and holding constraints.

---

### Tools Used

- Excel Solver (Simplex LP Method)
- Linear Programming (Maximize Profit Objective)
- Business Logic Constraints (Storage limits, demand thresholds, cost rules)
